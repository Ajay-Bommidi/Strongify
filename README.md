Strongify
Strongify is a user-friendly, GUI-based password generator built in Python, designed to create secure, random passwords for everyday users. As my first project, Strongify showcases a minimal yet functional graphical interface to enhance online security. Its successor, PassFort, evolves this concept into a powerful CLI-based tool with improved user experience and stronger password generation.
🚀 Why Strongify?
Passwords are the first line of defense in cybersecurity. Strongify empowers users to:

Generate Secure Passwords: Creates random, customizable passwords to protect against brute-force attacks.
Learn Python GUI Development: Demonstrates skills in Python and Tkinter for building accessible interfaces.
Showcase Growth: Evolved into PassFort, a CLI tool with advanced features, reflecting my journey in software development.
Impress Recruiters: A portfolio project highlighting programming, UI design, and cybersecurity awareness.

🛠️ Features

Graphical Interface: Built with Tkinter for a simple, intuitive experience.
Customizable Passwords: Adjust length and character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
Random Generation: Uses Python’s secrets module for cryptographically secure passwords.
Educational Value: A beginner-friendly project demonstrating GUI programming and security basics.

📋 Prerequisites

Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Python: Version 3.8 or higher.
Dependencies: Tkinter (usually included with Python).

🛠️ Installation

Clone the Repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Ajay-Bommidi/Strongify.git
cd Strongify
```


Set Up Python Environment (optional, for isolation) for linux:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```


Install Dependencies (if Tkinter isn’t included):
sudo apt install python3-tk  # On Debian/Ubuntu
# Or equivalent for your OS



🚀 Usage
Run Strongify’s GUI:
```
python3 strongify.py
```


Enter desired password length and character preferences.
Click “Generate” to create a secure password.
Copy the password for use.

Example:
```sh
python3 strongify.py
```
# For the CLI experience, try PassFort:

🧪 Testing

Test Locally: Run Strongify on your machine and verify password generation.
Capture Screenshots: Take images of the GUI and share via GitHub issues to enhance this README.
Compare with PassFort: Test both tools to see the GUI-to-CLI evolution.

🔒 Security Considerations

Strongify: Uses secrets for secure randomization, suitable for personal use.
PassFort: Offers advanced options (e.g., entropy checks) for stronger passwords.
Best Practices: Never reuse passwords; use a password manager for storage.
